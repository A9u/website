They have been able to meet our targets despite strict requirements and tight timelines on all three projects. Due to the highly customized nature of the ERP solutions and the Android app, requirements were often increased in scope or new requirements added as the projects progressed.

They had worked with a lot of startups across the world with good customer feedback on quality as well as timelines.

With regard to technology, the Josh team's knowledge of Ruby, Postgres, Rest APIs, AWS, Regex, web crawling, data management, and systems integration far exceed all other non-US resources and frankly have proven to be much better than many Silicon Valley developers that we have worked with in the past. Along with modern software development stack, Josh team also uses modern development tools including Pivotaltracker, Github and provide detailed status updates to manage the project and keep our executives informed. The Josh team takes great pride in their work, takes great care to ensure their clients' success, and we have grown to feel strongly that our Josh team is part of the family in our venture.

Gautam's relaxed manner of project management worked well with our agile and fast pace of product development. I have found him flexible and accommodating with spec changes and timeline changes.
